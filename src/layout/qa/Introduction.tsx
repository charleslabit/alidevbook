                                The Playwright is an automation tool from Microsoft for reliable end-to-end testing for
                                modern web apps. The Playwright is a perfect rival against Selenium. The top two
                                contributors of Playwright are the same ones who created the Puppeteer; Puppeteer is an
                                open-source node-js-based framework built by Google.

                                        - Playwright runs tests in parallel. In order to achieve parallelism, it runs
                                        several worker processes together. Playwright Test can shard a test suite, so
                                        that it can be executed on multiple machines.

                                        session data. This can restrict repetitive login operations of each test.

                                        can achieve that via logging in for these users multiple times in a global setup
                                        configuration and saving that state into different files.

                                with many features and overcome almost all tradeoffs that Cypress had. Letâ€™s compare
                                Playwright and Cypress to understand when to use what.

                                                The Playwright does not define any folder structure, and you can
                                                configure it with the Test runner of your choice.

                                                The Playwright fully supports parallelization, even locally. Also,
                                                Playwright supports parallel tests within a single test file, and you
                                                can run tests on multiple browsers simultaneously.

                                                In Cypress, it is costly to implement parallelization. Also, to run
                                                Cypress tests in parallel, you need to split them across files, and you
                                                cannot run tests against multiple browsers at the same time.
